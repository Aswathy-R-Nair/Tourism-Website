                Located about 10 kms from Kochi, the Hill Palace Museum was the official residence of the erstwhile rulers of Kochi. Built in 1865, it is now famous for being a full-fledged Ethno-Archaeological Museum and Kerala's first-ever Heritage Museum. The palace complex itself comprises 49 buildings and is built in the traditional Kerala style of architecture. It has over 52 acres of terraced land around it.

                One can see oil paintings, murals, sculptures, manuscripts and belongings of the Kochi royal family. Antique ceramics from the Far East, Kudakkallu  (tombstone), Thoppikkallu (hood stone), laterite memorials and wooden memorials from ancient civilisations like the Indus Valley and Harappa can also be found here. It even has a gallery housing contemporary art. It is our pride to have relics of such value and significance placed here.

            A charming seaside area, Fort Kochi is known for its Dutch, Portuguese, and British colonial architecture, and elaborate bamboo fishing nets at Fort Kochi Beach. St. Francis Church was the original burial site of explorer Vasco da Gama. Upscale eateries and chic cafes serve Keralan specialties, and quaint shops sell cotton clothing and handmade souvenirs. Heritage buildings house contemporary art galleries.
            Fort Kochi can be reached from Ernakulam through roadways and water ways. Private buses and government transport buses travel from different parts of the city to Fort Kochi. Owing to the high volume of tourists visiting the place dedicated low floor Volvo buses were introduced to this route by the government. Such buses are in use on the popular routes such as Cochin International Airport (CIAL), Vytila Mobility Hub and Kakanad Info Park.
