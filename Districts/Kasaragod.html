                    The fort appears to emerge from the sea. Almost three-quarters of its exterior is in contact with water. Bekal fort was not an administrative centre and does not include any palaces or mansions.

                    An important feature is the water-tank, magazine and the flight of steps leading to an observation tower built by Tipu Sultan.[1] Standing at the centre of the fort, this offers views of the coastline and the towns of Kanhangad, Pallikkara, Bekal, Mavval, Kottikkulam, and Uduma.
                    
                    The fort's zigzag entrance and surrounding trenches reveal its defensive strategy. Holes on the outer walls are designed to defend the fort effectively from naval attacks. The upper holes meant for aiming at the farthest targets; lower holes below for striking as enemy nearer and the lowest holes to attacking enemy closest to the fort.[2]
                    
                    Its solid construction resembles the Thalassery Fort and the St. Angelo Fort at Kannur built by the Dutch .

                Over the years, Kasaragod acquired the considerable importance as a centre of Islam on the west coast. It is the site of one of the mosques believed to have been founded by Malik Dinar. According to Qissat Shakarwati Farmad, the mosques at Kodungallur, Kollam, Madayi, Barkur, Mangalore, Kasaragod, Kannur, Dharmadam, Panthalayini, and Chaliyam, were built during the era of Malik Dinar, and they are among the oldest mosques in Indian subcontinent.[1] It is believed that Malik Dinar died at Thalangara in Kasaragod town.

            Kasaragod region, prior to independence was part of South Canara district of Madras presidency directly under British Administration. It was included in the newly created state of Kerala after the re-organization of states on 1st November 1956. Kasaragod is well connected by Rail (SR) and Road (NH-17). There did not exist any lighthouse at Kasaragod prior to the present one. The Port entrance was identified by two masts each surmounted by a white ball. The construction of the present RCC Lighthouse Tower was taken up during 1982 and completed in 1984. The PRB-21 equipment supplied by ANA, New Delhi was installed and commissioned into service on 15th September 1984. The sealed beam lamps were replaced by auto headlights with Halogen lamps in December 1994. PRB 21 equipment replaced with TRB 220 of M/s Tideland in March 2009.
