                The Vadakkumnathan Temple is an ancient Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva in Thrissur, in the Thrissur district of Kerala, India. The temple is a classical example of the architectural style of Kerala and has one monumental tower on each of the four sides in addition to a koothambalam. Mural paintings depicting various scenes from the Mahabharata can be seen inside the temple. The shrines and the Kuttambalam display vignettes carved in wood. The temple, along with the mural paintings, has been declared as a National Monument by India under the AMASR Act. According to popular local lore, this is the first temple built by Parashurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu. Thekkinkadu Maidan, encircling the Vadakkumnathan Temple, is the main venue of the renowned Thrissur Pooram festival. In 2012, the Archaeological Survey of India has recommended 14 sites, including Vadakkumnathan Temple and palaces, from Kerala to include in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The temple is also the first one among the 108 Shiva Temples in ancient Kerala, established by Parashurama, and is mentioned in the Shiva Temple Stotra as Shrimad-Dakshina Kailasam, meaning 'Mt. Kailash of the South'.

            Kerala is a nature-lover's paradise, and on this convenient day trip from Kochi you'll visit two of the state's most beautiful waterfalls: Athirapilly and Vazhachal. The forested mountains surrounding the neighboring falls are full of animals and rare bird life, including elephants, which you may spot. Active travelers can also hike to the base of the falls, for some physical exercise and spectacular views.
            Athirapilly Falls is situated in Athirapilly Panchayat in Chalakudy Taluk of Thrissur District in Kerala, India on the Chalakudy River, which originates from the upper reaches of the Western Ghats at the entrance to the Sholayar ranges. It is the largest waterfall in Kerala, which stands tall at 81.5 feet. Just a short drive from Athirapilly to the Vazhachal Falls, which is close to dense green forests that are home to many endangered and endemic species of flora and fauna.

There is another waterfall on the way from Athirapilly to Vazhachal Falls, in close proximity to the road, which is locally called "Charpa Falls". Athirappilly Falls is the largest waterfall in Kerala and is nicknamed "The Niagara of South India".[1]

            Kerala Kalamandalam has, for decades, been regarded as the most prestigious Kathakali school in the entire world. This legendary school of art is located in Cheruthuruthy and was originally set up by the famous poet of Malayalam, Vallathol Narayana Menon. The story goes that he recognised a subtle decrease in the interest people had in Kathakali and other traditional art forms and thus started the venture. Today, the Kalamandalam is the foremost proponent of a variety of traditional performing art forms that include Mohiniyattam, Kutiyattam, Thullal and Nangiarkoothu. It is also an official deemed University for Art and Culture.

Founded in 1930 along the banks of the Nila (Bharathapuzha) River in Thrissur District, its ambience has assisted and nurtured Kerala’s traditional art forms for nearly a century. Performances and classes are regularly held in Kalamandalam, fostered by its quaint charm. Eminent artists from across the state and beyond perform regularly at its famous dance theatre, Koothambalam. Interestingly, it is the only one of its kind to be built outside a Temple complex. The Koothambalam’s granite pillars are famous for having one hundred and eight karanas (dance-poses) inscribed on them. Watching recitals in these hallowed halls is an ethereal experience. A number of scholarships and awards, sponsored by patrons from across the world, are regularly awarded to aid the student’s journey as artists.
