                    Beypore is a cosy coastal town tucked away in the small but striking Kozhikode District. Located at the mouth of the energetic Chaliyar River, this town is covered in vibrant shades of green and surrounded by mystic shades of blue. When under the reign of Tipu Sultan, who was the ruler of Mysore, this town was named Sultan Pattanam.

                    In spite of being a small town, it is very famous for ship-building. The shipbuilding yard here is renowned for the construction of Urus and Dhows, the traditional Arabian trading vessel. This craft is over 1500 years old now and is carried out carefully by the expert craftsmen who possess extraordinary skills.
